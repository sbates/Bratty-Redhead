  <div class="entry-content"><p>Generalists are awesome. &nbsp;Value them or you&#8217;re doomed. &nbsp;They make the best diagnosticians, especially when systems are large, complex, distributed and workgroups reside in silos.</p>
<p>Cloud is awesome. &nbsp;Except when it&#8217;s not. &nbsp;Understand your vulnerabilities. Plan for failure. Don&#8217;t abuse your ops guys. Don&#8217;t abuse your devs. &nbsp;Be interested in what others are doing even if it doesn&#8217;t (seem to) directly apply to your job.</p>
<p>Buy a fucking SSD. &nbsp;Hack your kernel. &nbsp;</p>
<p>DNS is sexy. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Just because it&#8217;s up doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s working.</p>
<p>Why use IBM when we have Rabbit?</p>
<p>Often the best solution is a hybrid. &nbsp;Don&#8217;t reinvent the internets unless you&#8217;re feeling clever.</p>
<p>Sales guys employ dragons and fire to prosecute leads. &nbsp;Shun assholes. &nbsp;OS projects should never skip over the governance role. &nbsp;You can always tell who&#8217;s doing devops right because they are genuinely happy.</p>
<p>Etsy used to be the anti-pattern for awesome until they experienced a culture shift causing them to become our role model for even more awesome. &nbsp;LOLcats and LOLgoats make presentations even better.</p>
<p>The best part about Surge is knowing that I was surrounded by so many smart people. &nbsp;I love the hallway track and listening to others talk about their systems, the challenges and solutions. &nbsp;I love hearing about project goals that would never have occurred to me. &nbsp;I love all the ideas I get from all the smart people talking around me all the time.</p>
<p>The only unfortunate part of the week was that there were several opposing talks where I would have liked to see both. &nbsp;I hope that there are some videos posted eventually.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>What is DevOps?<span>&nbsp; </span>2 years ago I had no idea.<span>&nbsp; </span>I was living the cycle of poorly planned, crappily implemented projects where artisan server builds were the only way anything was built, even when it meant 125 servers. <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I actually had a PM say to my team, &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have TIME to plan!<span>&nbsp; </span>You need to start building servers!&rdquo;<span>&nbsp; </span>I was gone for two weeks to Europe right after that and when I came back, one of my sysadmins had indeed kickstarted all 125 servers. We then spent the next 6 months fixing configurations via ssh cli foo (for i in servers; do ssh $i some monkeypatch;done).</p>
<p>I tell you this anecdote so you can understand the utter delight and abandon with which I embraced the DevOps movment when introduced 18 months ago.<span>&nbsp; </span>I was immediately wowed by the positive, inclusive attitude.<span>&nbsp; </span>I read about continuous deployment, continuous integration, test driven deployment, configuration management tools and the personal experiences of several people.<span>&nbsp; </span>I found the<a href="http://dev2ops.org/blog" title="DTO Blog" target="_blank"> DTO blog</a>, the <a href="http://theagileadmin.com/" title="Agile Admin" target="_blank">Agile Admin</a> and, of course, the Etsy <a href="http://codeascraft.etsy.com/" title="Code as Craft" target="_blank">Code as Craft</a> blog.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>It&#8217;s great to see people engaged, animated and motivated to make things awesome.<span>&nbsp; </span>Instead of being beat down, embracing the ops-as-victims lifestyle, they&#8217;ve taken charge of their world and started trying to change what&#8217;s not working instead of just turning into the troll under the bridge.<span>&nbsp; </span>I&rsquo;ve spent over 10 years in corporate and I know how easy it is to feel beat down by the constant cycle of develop, implement, fail, support the failure forever.<span>&nbsp; </span>So I love me a movement that engages and tries to proactively to end the failure cycle.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>In June I had my first community interaction events at Velocity and Devopsdays, in San Jose. The atmosphere was different from any other industry conference I&rsquo;ve attended in the past.<span>&nbsp; </span>It was awesome.<span>&nbsp; </span>The energy was amazing.<span>&nbsp; </span>Many of the talks were inspiring(<a href="http://www.kitchensoap.com/" title="John Allspaw" target="_blank">John Allspaw</a>, Adam Jacob, I&rsquo;m talking to you).<span>&nbsp; </span>I finished the week with a hyperactive energy and desire to channel that energy into about 10 new things I&rsquo;d learned about.</p>
<p>A common theme during presentations, panels <span>&nbsp;</span>and over beer was the attempt to define the DevOps movement. <span>&nbsp;</span>I heard a lot of people at Velocity tell me what it&#8217;s not.<span>&nbsp; </span>It&#8217;s not a tool, it&#8217;s not a job, it&#8217;s not a job description; it&#8217;s not a title.<span>&nbsp; </span>I heard a lot of, &#8220;if you claim to be &#8216;devops,&#8217; yer doin it wrong.&#8221;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>Interestingly, in high school and college, I ran with a punk rock/goth crowd with a similar attitude.<span>&nbsp; </span>&#8220;If you claim you&#8217;re punk rock or goth, yer doin it wrong.&#8221;<span>&nbsp; </span>We were too cool for labels.<span>&nbsp; </span>In our own minds, we were outside the labeling system.<span>&nbsp; </span>Sticking a label on us or on yourself was lame and small minded.<span>&nbsp; </span>We&#8217;d say things like, &#8220;I&#8217;m not goth.<span>&nbsp; </span>I&#8217;m just myself.<span>&nbsp; </span>I don&rsquo;t conform to labels.&#8221;<span>&nbsp; </span>We were pretentious by pretending that only pretentious people actually labeled themselves.<span>&nbsp; </span>If you claimed to be punk, obviously you were a poser.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sensing a lot of that same attitude from the folks who say, &#8220;if you call yourself a devop, yer doin it wrong.&#8221;<span>&nbsp; </span>I understand some of the desire to protect the movement from spoilage and the term from overuse.<span>&nbsp; </span>We want to keep our counterculture to ourselves.<span>&nbsp; </span>It&rsquo;s not for the likes of HP and IBM and their re-branding of old, tired products.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>I understand what people mean.<span>&nbsp; </span>Labels get in the way of the movement.<span>&nbsp; </span>Labels are limiting and, if you say you &#8220;do devops&#8221; you risk limiting yourself and the perceptions of others. I can even empathize.<span>&nbsp; </span>Every time a job comes through my inbox labeled &ldquo;devops,&rdquo; I cynically assume it&rsquo;s someone who wants to rope some poor sap of a sysadmin into a crap job by labeling it with something cool, probably hoping to get two kinds of work for the price of one.<span> </span></p>
<p>Everyone claims to be living in the DevOps moment, but what does it really mean?<span>&nbsp; Several people have asked this question and tried to answer it.&nbsp; </span>My business card has &lsquo;DevOps&rsquo; on it.<span>&nbsp; </span>But it also says Problem Solving, Middleware and other things.<span>&nbsp; </span>How dare I list Devops among my skill set? <span>&nbsp;</span>Here&#8217;s the thing.<span>&nbsp; </span>If DevOps isn&#8217;t a tool, if it isn&#8217;t a job description, if it isn&#8217;t a title, it still must describe something right?<span>&nbsp; </span>It can&rsquo;t be an empty set.<span>&nbsp; </span>Here&#8217;s what I was thinking when I put it on my card.<span>&nbsp; </span>DevOps is a framework and a philosophy.<span>&nbsp; </span>It&#8217;s a lightly codified framework for an attitude and approach to solving problems. DevOps contains the seeds from which a better culture can grow. <span>&nbsp;</span>It assumes inclusiveness, accountability and that everyone is smart. It dismisses boundaries. When I put DevOps on my business card, what I&#8217;m saying is, the word defines part of the way I think, the way I approach problem solving and it also defines the attitude I&#8217;m looking for when evaluating engagements.</p>
<p>Because of all the positive vibe around DevOps, it bothers me when I see snotty tweets or hear snarky remarks during conference presentations.&nbsp; You can call bullshit when HP starts trying to claim that its monitoring suite is &#8220;devops friendly,&#8221; or when Gartner starts writing articles that could be subtitled &#8220;How to cash in on the DevOps movement.&#8221;&nbsp; But projecting an attitude of exclusivity or just plain snark because you&#8217;re feeling protective can only hurt things.&nbsp; New folks are continually stumbling upon parts of DevOps or agile infrastructure as a movement.&nbsp; Some of them have been living the attitude for years and maybe just now realizing there are others out there.&nbsp; I guess I&#8217;d rather be a hippy flashing a peace sign at people who happen across DevOps than a hipster turning my nose up at anyone who doesn&#8217;t meet my specific criteria for cool.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>About 4 years ago, I was working for a remote client, building a  large, fragile Yantra/WebSphere environment.&nbsp; The client had chosen to  use the WebSphere embedded messaging engine (instead of MQ) for systems  critical order processing.&nbsp; The project was big, I was busy, traveling  to the client site every week and I had a constant backlog of work.&nbsp; It  seemed like there was never enough time or people to get all the work  done.<p />One day the dev team came to me with their list of 15  queues that needed configuring in dev.&nbsp; I was already overrun, had no  time and typically working 12 hours or more on the days I was onsite.<p />If  you&#8217;ve ever worked with WebSphere, you know that you pretty much get  two choices for configs: the GUI console or scripts.&nbsp; The scripting  language is based on either jython or tcl but the WebSphere specific DSL  is a bitch to deal with if you don&#8217;t know the syntax really well.<p />I  really wanted to write some WebSphere scripts to install and configure  the queues, but I told myself I just didn&#8217;t have time, what with all of  the probable debugging and figuring out how to deal with the syntactical  challenges.&nbsp; I figured it would take me less time and I&#8217;d just kick out  the queue configs super quick via the GUI.&nbsp; The GUI is tedious but not  hard and I didn&#8217;t have time to play with scripting, I thought.<p />Except.&nbsp;  All the naming was wrong apparently.&nbsp; All the queues had to be deleted a  few days later and re-created.&nbsp; I told myself the second time that it  wouldn&#8217;t happen again and I&#8217;d just be wasting valuable time, writing  scripts that wouldn&#8217;t be used again.<p />Except.&nbsp; They had to be  recreated a few times in the Test environment, for several reasons.&nbsp; And  then eventually they were revamped again to match up better with  something else.&nbsp; Not to mention we had to do the work on the queues in  prod.&nbsp; I hear that, after the project went live, they reconfigured the  queues a few more times after that.<p />This situation is one of the  more glaring moments where I can look back and say, man, you should have  taken the couple or 3 hours to write some automation scripts for a  seemingly trivial task.&nbsp; This would have made sense for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>3 hours of concentrated (and let&#8217;s face it fun) time to get some  scripts written, instead of numerous occasions being interrupted to do  trivial admin work by hand</li>
<li>&nbsp;If I had written a script, anyone on the team or even someone from the noc could have done the work instead</li>
<li>I might have left something after the project that was useful in the  long run as a legacy and as an example for further scripting for the  admins who stayed behind</li>
</ul>
<p><br />I was just telling this story last week and thought that it could  really stand repeating for posterity.&nbsp; Taking the extra time to write a  script that automates a lame manual process is NEVER time wasted.&nbsp; Not  ever.&nbsp; And if anyone tries to tell you differently, you&#8217;re probably too  smart to be working with them.<br />﻿</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="https://github.com/sbates/Chef-odds-n-ends/blob/master/ohai/parse_host_plugin.rb" title="The plugin at github" target="_blank">The plugin at github</a></p>
<p>When we started the Chef infrastructure automation project last year,  a dev team started up at nearly the same time.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t know enough  about Chef to have (much of) an opinion on how others were addressing  cookbook issues they faced. So for the first few months, I worked on my  problems to solve while the devs worked on theirs.&nbsp; I did eventually  started paying attention to what was going on with the dev team and  discovered that they had started to create role names that looked like  app_name_env(e.g. riak_prod), causing a role for each app to be created  in each environment, but with nearly identical run lists.&nbsp; They were  labeling their attributes with environment and used the roles to sort  them out.</p>
<p>So we came up with a quick solution.&nbsp; We created an attribute called  node[:env] and put it in a role called env_dev, env_qa, etc.&nbsp; And the  same goes for other things we needed to set like node[:swimlane] and  node[:zone]. Every time a node was created, relevant env attribute roles  were added along with the platform_base and any application roles.&nbsp; We  all refactored our code and started using the env variable to sort out  environment-specific attributes. This worked well in the short term, for  about 6 months.</p>
<p>About 2 months ago, we started planning for provisioning a second  data center.&nbsp; With another data center containing two environments (prod  and stage) came a location issue.&nbsp; Now we have two sets of ntp servers,  different DNS servers and a whole host of location-specific coding  issues. I went to go add some location-specific roles and started  thinking about the refactoring we&rsquo;d need to do to account for two  locations.</p>
<p>As I started to make the first role, I realized that this was quickly  becoming an unwieldy solution.&nbsp; We were configuring the nodes managed  by our automation system <strong>by hand</strong>.&nbsp; This boggled me. And the number of managed nodes continues to grow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the problems we struggle with is that we have no system of  record.&nbsp; We get most of our new server info on spreadsheets from various  project teams or ops/mgmt teams.&nbsp; We can&rsquo;t call any central system API  to get info. &nbsp;All the servers have static IPs and minimum of two  networks. The ops team doesn&rsquo;t believe in DNS. So we have to keep all of  this information somewhere or figure out clever ways to deduce the  information we want (or set roles by hand, ugh!).</p>
<p>A secondary problem I had with the roles is that their attributes  weren&rsquo;t set early enough for me to use logic in the attributes file.&nbsp;  Node[:env] didn&rsquo;t get set until after attributes files were compile  which was causing me other problems.</p>
<p>So as I thought about the location role, I rebelled.&nbsp; I was <strong>done</strong> setting roles by hand.&nbsp; UGH!</p>
<p>All of our host names are the same length and contain a rich amount  of data encoded in their names.&nbsp; I thought that there must be a way to  extract and label that information for use as node attibutes.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m no  Ruby genius and I still struggle with anything beyond fancy scripting,  but it&rsquo;s extra fun for me to run at a problem head on and obsess over  it. And that&rsquo;s what I did.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I came out of the weekend, I had an oHai plugin that parsed a  host name, set 3 top level attributes and 5 nested attributes thatI  thought might be useful for logic in cookbooks.&nbsp; It looks like this:</p>
<p>[root@pxqpkyapp05 tmp]# ohai -f /tmp/plugins/parse_host_plugin.rb&nbsp; -l debug<br /> [Fri, 24 Jun 2011 19:09:09 -0500] DEBUG: ohai plugin: parse_host: parsing new host pxqpkyapp05<br /> {</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp; &#8220;environment&#8221;: &#8220;qa&#8221;</strong><br /> <strong>&nbsp; &#8220;location&#8221;: &#8220;pismo&#8221;,</strong><br /> &nbsp; &#8220;hostdata&#8221;: {<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;server_type&#8221;: &#8220;application&#8221;,<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;loc&#8221;: &#8220;p&#8221;,<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;env&#8221;: &#8220;q&#8221;,<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;application&#8221;: &#8220;Pooky&#8221;,<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;platform&#8221;: &#8220;solaris&#8221;<br /> &nbsp; },<br /> }<br /> ﻿</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t think this would be useful to anyone but us.&nbsp; Surely  everyone else was using Chef in the cloud, right?&nbsp; Heck no.&nbsp; It turns  out, as I was chatting with folks at Velocity last week, that several  people are data center-bound with encoded host names.&nbsp; Discussing it, I  thought it might be useful to share, even if it would require some  tweaking to make it work with any else&rsquo;s environment.</p>
<p>Basically, I set a hash with environment data and then set variables  using a regex on the host name.&nbsp; I set the environment and location vars  separately and then put indexes in the hash for any values I want to  add into the hostdata hash.&nbsp; I took most of our custom logic out, like  the node[:zone] logic that no one needs, although I left in a custom  piece I had to add for an oddly named environment at a third data center  location.&nbsp; All app names and locations have been changed to protect the  innocent (that&rsquo;s me).</p>
<p>I hope someone else can use it.&nbsp; It was my first step beyond recipes  and I&rsquo;m rather proud of it. I&#8217;ve already had a request from a team mate  to move the logic to a library so that we can use it in our host  management activities and that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m working on now.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve created a  class and a function that uses the class, but need to translate it to  Chef-specific DSL.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of how we&#8217;re using them:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>in the recipe: dnsinfo = search(:dns, &#8220;id:#{node.location}&#8221;)</p>
<p>in the template:</p>
<p>domain &lt;%= @dnsinfo[&#8220;domain&#8221;] %&gt;<br />search &lt;%= @dnsinfo[&#8220;search&#8221;] %&gt;<br />&lt;% @dnsinfo[&#8220;nameservers&#8221;].each do |ns| %&gt;<br />nameserver &lt;%= ns %&gt;<br />&lt;% end %&gt;</p>
<p># Unload unwanted packages<br />unless node.env == &#8220;dev&#8221; || node.attribute?(&#8220;keep_gcc&#8221;)<br />&nbsp;package &#8220;gcc&#8221; do<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; action :remove<br />&nbsp;end<br />end<p /></p>
<p>chefsearch = search(&#8220;chef_servers&#8221;,&#8221;env:#{node.env} AND id:#{node.hostdata.loc}*&#8221;).first<br />node.set.chef.my_chef_server = chefsearch[&#8220;id&#8221;]</p>
<p>node.set.chef.server_url = &#8220;http://#{node.chef.my_chef_server}&#8221;<br />node.set.chef.mrepo_url = &#8220;http://#{node.chef.my_chef_server}/mrepo&#8221;<br />node.set.chef.proxy_url = &#8220;http://#{node.chef.my_chef_server}:8000&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This will also come in handy once we&#8217;ve migrated to .10 where we can  set so many more things within Chef based on environment.&nbsp; The plugin is  phrased in functions as my original plugin file was rather messy with  comments and things.&nbsp; I felt like breaking it down this way made it  easier to follow wth was going on.</p>
<p>Please let me know if you find this useful or if you have questions.&nbsp;  This is my first community contribution and so I&#8217;m kind of like the kid  with the cool shiny thing they want to show everyone.&nbsp; Look at my  shiny!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;m a professional services consultant for a truly enormous  corporation; for two more weeks.&nbsp; I turned in my two week notice today.&nbsp;  I think I&rsquo;m all done working for big companies.&nbsp; I spent 8 years at a  major retail chain doing web architecture, middleware and ops and the  last 5 years consulting for the hosting, management and monitoring  portion of a megacorp.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I took this job, it was with a group that had been a much  smaller, recently acquired company.&nbsp; The feel was still pretty casual,  annual reviews were barely a formality, attitudes were laid back and  friendly and we rarely had to interact externally to our area. We had  separate time tracking, VPN and client systems access. &nbsp;I was told that  it still had a small-company feel and they were right mostly.&nbsp; I used a  separate VPN for email, travel booking and expense reporting.&nbsp; I was  sheltered from the corporation.&nbsp; All the engineers were.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t a rant about why corporations suck.&nbsp; They&rsquo;ve got a lot  going for them.&nbsp; This one kept me in a 6 figure salary, great benefits  and a 6% 401k match. I got paid even when I was benched, although that  wasn&rsquo;t often.&nbsp; If you&rsquo;re traditionally ambitious(re: mgmt chain), I hear  they&rsquo;re great for that too.&nbsp; If you&rsquo;re a slacker, you get a pass at a  big company.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s hard to be noticed.</p>
<p>Yeah.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s hard to be noticed.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve been through several re-orgs  since I was hired.&nbsp; ProServ was moved out of management and monitoring.&nbsp;  The work started getting monotonous.&nbsp; Half of ProServ was re-orgd out  of our group.&nbsp; We kept getting moved around.&nbsp; All our dedicated PMs were  moved to a central PMO.&nbsp; The ProServ team was largely forgotten except  by a few folks who managed our existing client base.&nbsp; Senior management  probably forgot we existed.&nbsp;&nbsp; We haven&#8217;t had a team meeting in a year.  My manager&#8217;s manager thinks I&#8217;m a man.</p>
<p>About a year ago I realized I was bored. I realized that, if I had to  architect one more WebSphere install, I might scream.&nbsp; No interesting  work was coming in.&nbsp; Very little work at all was coming in, for that  matter.&nbsp; I never lacked for work myself, but half my team was benched.&nbsp; I  started thinking about quitting.&nbsp; Then a call came in.</p>
<p>A friend working at one of our current clients was starting a  continuous integration project.&nbsp; He used to work for the same megacorp  and we&rsquo;d been friends for years.&nbsp;&nbsp; The work was outside my immediate  realm of experience.&nbsp; Learn Ruby, learn a new configuration management  tool called Chef and start figuring out how to automate the existing  infrastructure at this client.&nbsp; I was skeptical.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m pretty smart but I  have a realistic assessment of my own abilities and I had no coding  experience beyond some bash and python scripting.</p>
<p>So I dug in.&nbsp; I learned some Ruby syntax.&nbsp; I started figuring out  Chef.&nbsp; It was a steep curve but it was so interesting, fun and exciting  that I was thrilled with work for the first time in ages.&nbsp; I learned the  term &ldquo;devops.&rdquo;&nbsp; I read a bunch of blogs.&nbsp; I got really excited, in that  born again annoying kind of way.&nbsp; I knew it too and pretty much kept it  to myself, although sometimes at parties, I started gushing if someone  asked about work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve spent the last year doing some awesome work.&nbsp; The client  experience has been incredible.&nbsp; The dev teams we&rsquo;re working next to are  practicing agile concepts.&nbsp; We work in a large open space, with pairing  monitors everywhere and you can&#8217;t throw a pen without hitting corporate  issue macs.&nbsp; The dev teams pair and we sometimes cross-team pair on  things.&nbsp; Our team has a 10 min standup every morning.&nbsp; We track stories  in a tool and showcase at our weekly planning (usually code review since  Chef configs aren&rsquo;t really &ldquo;featurable&rdquo;).&nbsp; We&rsquo;re getting monitors soon  and trying to figure out how to hook Chef into graphite to start  metricizing.</p>
<p>Something that really resonated with me at Velocity on the last day  was Adam Jacobs who said, &ldquo;You can tell the people who are doing devops  right because they&rsquo;re HAPPY all the time.&rdquo;&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s been like.&nbsp;  I&rsquo;ve never enjoyed anything so much as I have this last year.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, working for a megacorp has intruded on my professional  happiness too many times this year for me to ignore it any longer.&nbsp;  I&rsquo;ve known for a few months that this was coming.&nbsp; The project work I&rsquo;ve  been doing for the last year has been awesome and I don&rsquo;t want to leave  it behind.&nbsp; Growing my Ruby development skills has been super fun and a  big challenge.&nbsp; I hope to do more of that going forward and am planning  to work on my own projects as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the meantime, I&rsquo;m going to take a little time off, ride my bike,  write some code, evaluate my options and see what&rsquo;s out there for me.</p>
