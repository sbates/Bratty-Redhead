<p>I&rsquo;m a professional services consultant for a truly enormous  corporation; for two more weeks.&nbsp; I turned in my two week notice today.&nbsp;  I think I&rsquo;m all done working for big companies.&nbsp; I spent 8 years at a  major retail chain doing web architecture, middleware and ops and the  last 5 years consulting for the hosting, management and monitoring  portion of a megacorp.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I took this job, it was with a group that had been a much  smaller, recently acquired company.&nbsp; The feel was still pretty casual,  annual reviews were barely a formality, attitudes were laid back and  friendly and we rarely had to interact externally to our area. We had  separate time tracking, VPN and client systems access. &nbsp;I was told that  it still had a small-company feel and they were right mostly.&nbsp; I used a  separate VPN for email, travel booking and expense reporting.&nbsp; I was  sheltered from the corporation.&nbsp; All the engineers were.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t a rant about why corporations suck.&nbsp; They&rsquo;ve got a lot  going for them.&nbsp; This one kept me in a 6 figure salary, great benefits  and a 6% 401k match. I got paid even when I was benched, although that  wasn&rsquo;t often.&nbsp; If you&rsquo;re traditionally ambitious(re: mgmt chain), I hear  they&rsquo;re great for that too.&nbsp; If you&rsquo;re a slacker, you get a pass at a  big company.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s hard to be noticed.</p>
<p>Yeah.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s hard to be noticed.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve been through several re-orgs  since I was hired.&nbsp; ProServ was moved out of management and monitoring.&nbsp;  The work started getting monotonous.&nbsp; Half of ProServ was re-orgd out  of our group.&nbsp; We kept getting moved around.&nbsp; All our dedicated PMs were  moved to a central PMO.&nbsp; The ProServ team was largely forgotten except  by a few folks who managed our existing client base.&nbsp; Senior management  probably forgot we existed.&nbsp;&nbsp; We haven't had a team meeting in a year.  My manager's manager thinks I'm a man.</p>
<p>About a year ago I realized I was bored. I realized that, if I had to  architect one more WebSphere install, I might scream.&nbsp; No interesting  work was coming in.&nbsp; Very little work at all was coming in, for that  matter.&nbsp; I never lacked for work myself, but half my team was benched.&nbsp; I  started thinking about quitting.&nbsp; Then a call came in.</p>
<p>A friend working at one of our current clients was starting a  continuous integration project.&nbsp; He used to work for the same megacorp  and we&rsquo;d been friends for years.&nbsp;&nbsp; The work was outside my immediate  realm of experience.&nbsp; Learn Ruby, learn a new configuration management  tool called Chef and start figuring out how to automate the existing  infrastructure at this client.&nbsp; I was skeptical.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m pretty smart but I  have a realistic assessment of my own abilities and I had no coding  experience beyond some bash and python scripting.</p>
<p>So I dug in.&nbsp; I learned some Ruby syntax.&nbsp; I started figuring out  Chef.&nbsp; It was a steep curve but it was so interesting, fun and exciting  that I was thrilled with work for the first time in ages.&nbsp; I learned the  term &ldquo;devops.&rdquo;&nbsp; I read a bunch of blogs.&nbsp; I got really excited, in that  born again annoying kind of way.&nbsp; I knew it too and pretty much kept it  to myself, although sometimes at parties, I started gushing if someone  asked about work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve spent the last year doing some awesome work.&nbsp; The client  experience has been incredible.&nbsp; The dev teams we&rsquo;re working next to are  practicing agile concepts.&nbsp; We work in a large open space, with pairing  monitors everywhere and you can't throw a pen without hitting corporate  issue macs.&nbsp; The dev teams pair and we sometimes cross-team pair on  things.&nbsp; Our team has a 10 min standup every morning.&nbsp; We track stories  in a tool and showcase at our weekly planning (usually code review since  Chef configs aren&rsquo;t really &ldquo;featurable&rdquo;).&nbsp; We&rsquo;re getting monitors soon  and trying to figure out how to hook Chef into graphite to start  metricizing.</p>
<p>Something that really resonated with me at Velocity on the last day  was Adam Jacobs who said, &ldquo;You can tell the people who are doing devops  right because they&rsquo;re HAPPY all the time.&rdquo;&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s been like.&nbsp;  I&rsquo;ve never enjoyed anything so much as I have this last year.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, working for a megacorp has intruded on my professional  happiness too many times this year for me to ignore it any longer.&nbsp;  I&rsquo;ve known for a few months that this was coming.&nbsp; The project work I&rsquo;ve  been doing for the last year has been awesome and I don&rsquo;t want to leave  it behind.&nbsp; Growing my Ruby development skills has been super fun and a  big challenge.&nbsp; I hope to do more of that going forward and am planning  to work on my own projects as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the meantime, I&rsquo;m going to take a little time off, ride my bike,  write some code, evaluate my options and see what&rsquo;s out there for me.</p>
