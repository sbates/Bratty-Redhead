<p>Generalists are awesome. &nbsp;Value them or you're doomed. &nbsp;They make the best diagnosticians, especially when systems are large, complex, distributed and workgroups reside in silos.</p>
<p>Cloud is awesome. &nbsp;Except when it's not. &nbsp;Understand your vulnerabilities. Plan for failure. Don't abuse your ops guys. Don't abuse your devs. &nbsp;Be interested in what others are doing even if it doesn't (seem to) directly apply to your job.</p>
<p>Buy a fucking SSD. &nbsp;Hack your kernel. &nbsp;</p>
<p>DNS is sexy. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Just because it's up doesn't mean it's working.</p>
<p>Why use IBM when we have Rabbit?</p>
<p>Often the best solution is a hybrid. &nbsp;Don't reinvent the internets unless you're feeling clever.</p>
<p>Sales guys employ dragons and fire to prosecute leads. &nbsp;Shun assholes. &nbsp;OS projects should never skip over the governance role. &nbsp;You can always tell who's doing devops right because they are genuinely happy.</p>
<p>Etsy used to be the anti-pattern for awesome until they experienced a culture shift causing them to become our role model for even more awesome. &nbsp;LOLcats and LOLgoats make presentations even better.</p>
<p>The best part about Surge is knowing that I was surrounded by so many smart people. &nbsp;I love the hallway track and listening to others talk about their systems, the challenges and solutions. &nbsp;I love hearing about project goals that would never have occurred to me. &nbsp;I love all the ideas I get from all the smart people talking around me all the time.</p>
<p>The only unfortunate part of the week was that there were several opposing talks where I would have liked to see both. &nbsp;I hope that there are some videos posted eventually.</p>
