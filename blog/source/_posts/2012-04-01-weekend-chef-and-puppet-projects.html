<p>I have a few clients that I keep in touch with and take on small projects from time to time.&nbsp; This has been a strange week.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m technically full time on a project at the moment and I haven&rsquo;t gotten any calls for new work in a couple of months.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s been quiet.&nbsp; Then all of the sudden Wednesday I had 3 different people contact me about work.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />One call was actually for some awesome Chef work at a place I&rsquo;ve been before that I&rsquo;d love to go back to.&nbsp; It really pained me to tell them that I thought they had in-house resources of which they weren&rsquo;t aware and that these resources would be more than sufficient to Chef their project without my help. Sadface Sascha.</p>
<p><br />Another call was from someone I do work for from time to time.&nbsp; Their projects source my &ldquo;Puppet for Chef&rdquo; series, if 2 blog posts can be called a series.&nbsp; In my head I have a 3rd one on templates but haven&rsquo;t gotten around to it yet. This 3wk run may source some if I&rsquo;m lucky. I agreed to do some ad hoc sysadmin work for these guys because they&rsquo;re in a swivet, getting ready for a PCI audit in 3 weeks.</p>
<p>The job: There are about 150 Centos 5 servers. Caveat: some of the servers on the list may be retired already.&nbsp; Examine all of the configuration files for ConfigServer Firewall, bring them under Puppet control. Individual node config sets are ok (ugh).&nbsp; All servers are running a puppet client.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s the same client.&nbsp; The master was at 2.7.9 last I checked, I think.<p />I have a mini Chef project too for the weekend, but I think I&rsquo;ll save that for another blog post.&nbsp; I actually wrote post of this post on Saturday morning and am just finishing it up. I haven&rsquo;t actually started my Puppet stuff except to wonder if they have some command line tools and think I&rsquo;d better get to writing some tcp testers and comparison scripts if there isn&rsquo;t such a thing.</p>
<p><br />I actually spent a chunk of time working on my Chef thing which was an exercise in frustration.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s for a Windows Ohai plugin and the actual ruby work was a piece of cake. Testing has made me crazy though.&nbsp; Windows servers don&rsquo;t fire up as fast as Linux for one and they are a huge pain in the ass to interact with.&nbsp; On my todo list is an SSH server for Windows cookbook, unless my ultimate wish of hoping that all Windows servers DIAF happens prior to that.&nbsp; The ssh cookbook is half done, like so many things.</p>
<p>I also am not sure I understand the testing strategy.&nbsp; I didn't write any new code so I shouldn't need to author any tests (relief).&nbsp; But it turns out I can't seen any windows testing happening in the run, or at least, I think that's what's not happening.&nbsp; It ran happily on my Mac and then I thought maybe I should run the test on the Windows box too to see if the output was different.&nbsp; It was different.&nbsp; But I think that's because there's no Windows plugin tests in there?&nbsp; Wondering if I missed them?&nbsp; I was planning to email the chef-dev list tomorrow to see if I can get some love.&nbsp; Unfortunately the time I have to work on pet projects is the weekends and the IRC channels were like graveyards this weekend.<p />But I digress.&nbsp; I also ran manual tests - you know, the kind where you do stuff by hand and watch the output? My Ohai changes tested perfectly sanely on my Windows 7 64bit workstation.&nbsp; They tested insanely on a 2008r2 VMware VM I had available to me.&nbsp; And when I went into ec2 to fire up a neutral 2008r2, I discovered Ohai hangs on gathering ec2 metadata when run from the command line.&nbsp; I have no idea why.&nbsp; I hand-edited the ec2 plugin and the mixin/ec2_metadata to try and eke out some debug info but I got no joy.&nbsp; While the problem fascinated me, that was as far down that yak shave as I wanted to go today.&nbsp; So I put away the Chef and cleaned up the yard for 2 hours.</p>
<p>Now I guess it's time to play with Puppet!</p>
