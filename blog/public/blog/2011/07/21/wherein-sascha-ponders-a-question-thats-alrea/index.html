<div class="entry-content"><p>What is DevOps?<span>&nbsp; </span>2 years ago I had no idea.<span>&nbsp; </span>I was living the cycle of poorly planned, crappily implemented projects where artisan server builds were the only way anything was built, even when it meant 125 servers. <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I actually had a PM say to my team, &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have TIME to plan!<span>&nbsp; </span>You need to start building servers!&rdquo;<span>&nbsp; </span>I was gone for two weeks to Europe right after that and when I came back, one of my sysadmins had indeed kickstarted all 125 servers. We then spent the next 6 months fixing configurations via ssh cli foo (for i in servers; do ssh $i some monkeypatch;done).</p>
<p>I tell you this anecdote so you can understand the utter delight and abandon with which I embraced the DevOps movment when introduced 18 months ago.<span>&nbsp; </span>I was immediately wowed by the positive, inclusive attitude.<span>&nbsp; </span>I read about continuous deployment, continuous integration, test driven deployment, configuration management tools and the personal experiences of several people.<span>&nbsp; </span>I found the<a href="http://dev2ops.org/blog" title="DTO Blog" target="_blank"> DTO blog</a>, the <a href="http://theagileadmin.com/" title="Agile Admin" target="_blank">Agile Admin</a> and, of course, the Etsy <a href="http://codeascraft.etsy.com/" title="Code as Craft" target="_blank">Code as Craft</a> blog.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>It&#8217;s great to see people engaged, animated and motivated to make things awesome.<span>&nbsp; </span>Instead of being beat down, embracing the ops-as-victims lifestyle, they&#8217;ve taken charge of their world and started trying to change what&#8217;s not working instead of just turning into the troll under the bridge.<span>&nbsp; </span>I&rsquo;ve spent over 10 years in corporate and I know how easy it is to feel beat down by the constant cycle of develop, implement, fail, support the failure forever.<span>&nbsp; </span>So I love me a movement that engages and tries to proactively to end the failure cycle.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>In June I had my first community interaction events at Velocity and Devopsdays, in San Jose. The atmosphere was different from any other industry conference I&rsquo;ve attended in the past.<span>&nbsp; </span>It was awesome.<span>&nbsp; </span>The energy was amazing.<span>&nbsp; </span>Many of the talks were inspiring(<a href="http://www.kitchensoap.com/" title="John Allspaw" target="_blank">John Allspaw</a>, Adam Jacob, I&rsquo;m talking to you).<span>&nbsp; </span>I finished the week with a hyperactive energy and desire to channel that energy into about 10 new things I&rsquo;d learned about.</p>
<p>A common theme during presentations, panels <span>&nbsp;</span>and over beer was the attempt to define the DevOps movement. <span>&nbsp;</span>I heard a lot of people at Velocity tell me what it&#8217;s not.<span>&nbsp; </span>It&#8217;s not a tool, it&#8217;s not a job, it&#8217;s not a job description; it&#8217;s not a title.<span>&nbsp; </span>I heard a lot of, &#8220;if you claim to be &#8216;devops,&#8217; yer doin it wrong.&#8221;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>Interestingly, in high school and college, I ran with a punk rock/goth crowd with a similar attitude.<span>&nbsp; </span>&#8220;If you claim you&#8217;re punk rock or goth, yer doin it wrong.&#8221;<span>&nbsp; </span>We were too cool for labels.<span>&nbsp; </span>In our own minds, we were outside the labeling system.<span>&nbsp; </span>Sticking a label on us or on yourself was lame and small minded.<span>&nbsp; </span>We&#8217;d say things like, &#8220;I&#8217;m not goth.<span>&nbsp; </span>I&#8217;m just myself.<span>&nbsp; </span>I don&rsquo;t conform to labels.&#8221;<span>&nbsp; </span>We were pretentious by pretending that only pretentious people actually labeled themselves.<span>&nbsp; </span>If you claimed to be punk, obviously you were a poser.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sensing a lot of that same attitude from the folks who say, &#8220;if you call yourself a devop, yer doin it wrong.&#8221;<span>&nbsp; </span>I understand some of the desire to protect the movement from spoilage and the term from overuse.<span>&nbsp; </span>We want to keep our counterculture to ourselves.<span>&nbsp; </span>It&rsquo;s not for the likes of HP and IBM and their re-branding of old, tired products.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>I understand what people mean.<span>&nbsp; </span>Labels get in the way of the movement.<span>&nbsp; </span>Labels are limiting and, if you say you &#8220;do devops&#8221; you risk limiting yourself and the perceptions of others. I can even empathize.<span>&nbsp; </span>Every time a job comes through my inbox labeled &ldquo;devops,&rdquo; I cynically assume it&rsquo;s someone who wants to rope some poor sap of a sysadmin into a crap job by labeling it with something cool, probably hoping to get two kinds of work for the price of one.<span> </span></p>
<p>Everyone claims to be living in the DevOps moment, but what does it really mean?<span>&nbsp; Several people have asked this question and tried to answer it.&nbsp; </span>My business card has &lsquo;DevOps&rsquo; on it.<span>&nbsp; </span>But it also says Problem Solving, Middleware and other things.<span>&nbsp; </span>How dare I list Devops among my skill set? <span>&nbsp;</span>Here&#8217;s the thing.<span>&nbsp; </span>If DevOps isn&#8217;t a tool, if it isn&#8217;t a job description, if it isn&#8217;t a title, it still must describe something right?<span>&nbsp; </span>It can&rsquo;t be an empty set.<span>&nbsp; </span>Here&#8217;s what I was thinking when I put it on my card.<span>&nbsp; </span>DevOps is a framework and a philosophy.<span>&nbsp; </span>It&#8217;s a lightly codified framework for an attitude and approach to solving problems. DevOps contains the seeds from which a better culture can grow. <span>&nbsp;</span>It assumes inclusiveness, accountability and that everyone is smart. It dismisses boundaries. When I put DevOps on my business card, what I&#8217;m saying is, the word defines part of the way I think, the way I approach problem solving and it also defines the attitude I&#8217;m looking for when evaluating engagements.</p>
<p>Because of all the positive vibe around DevOps, it bothers me when I see snotty tweets or hear snarky remarks during conference presentations.&nbsp; You can call bullshit when HP starts trying to claim that its monitoring suite is &#8220;devops friendly,&#8221; or when Gartner starts writing articles that could be subtitled &#8220;How to cash in on the DevOps movement.&#8221;&nbsp; But projecting an attitude of exclusivity or just plain snark because you&#8217;re feeling protective can only hurt things.&nbsp; New folks are continually stumbling upon parts of DevOps or agile infrastructure as a movement.&nbsp; Some of them have been living the attitude for years and maybe just now realizing there are others out there.&nbsp; I guess I&#8217;d rather be a hippy flashing a peace sign at people who happen across DevOps than a hipster turning my nose up at anyone who doesn&#8217;t meet my specific criteria for cool.</p>
